# discovery-data-analysis
Scripts for analysing and plotting data obtained using scripts in the [DiscoveryAPI repository](https://github.com/DavidUnderdown/DiscoveryAPI).  Again this was inspired by Dr Richard Dunley's blog post [Catalogue as Data: the basics](http://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/catalogue-data-basics/).

Any data from [The National Archives' Discovery database](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) in this repository in the form of CSV files or charts derived from those files is under the [Open Government License, v3](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/).
